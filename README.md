# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-Classification
Deep learning solution for brain tumor segmentation &amp; classification using U-Net, Attention U-Net, and advanced CNNs on the BRISC 2025 dataset. PyTorch implementation.

A comprehensive deep learning pipeline for automated brain tumor segmentation and classification from T1-weighted MRI scans. This project implements multiple state-of-the-art architectures including U-Net, Attention U-Net, MobileNetV2, EfficientNet, and DenseNet on the BRISC 2025 dataset (6,000 MRI slices, 4 tumor classes). Features include joint training analysis, hyperparameter optimization, BiFPN decoder implementation, and complete evaluation metrics (mIoU, Dice, accuracy, F1-score). Built with PyTorch.
